# Auto Clicker
## Description
In an attempt to solve a problem I encountered in one of my current hobbies: how can I click faster without destroying my hands in cookie clicker?
This python program uses threading and pynput module to create a toggle that will press mouse click repeatedly. 
## Installation
Install the latest version of Python and pynput.
## How to use
1. Run the python file.
2. Press Start/Stop key, default is ` (tilde), to start clicking.
3. When needed press Start/Stop key again to toggle off/on.
4. Press End key, default is =, to close program.
